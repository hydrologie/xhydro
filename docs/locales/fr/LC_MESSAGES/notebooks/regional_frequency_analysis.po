"This notebook will demonstrate how to use the ``xHydro`` library to "

"For this example, we will use the same dataset of hydrometric gauges "

"In regional frequency analyses, explanatory variables are used to help "

"After acquiring the explanatory variables, the next step is to process "

"The results show that the correlation between the components is close to "
"0, indicating that the first three components are sufficiently "

"for the remainder of our analysis, as they capture most of the variation "
"in the explanatory variables without significant overlap or "

"**Hosking and Wallis** introduced a method for regional frequency "
"analysis based on L-moments, which are particularly useful for analyzing "
"extreme events across different regions. Here’s a brief overview of the "
"key concepts:"
msgstr ""

#: ../../notebooks/regional_frequency_analysis.ipynb:2202
msgid ""
"**L-Moments**: L-moments are statistical measures that are derived from "
"linear combinations of order statistics. They offer a more robust "
"alternative to traditional moments (like mean and variance), especially "
"in the presence of outliers or when dealing with small sample sizes. "
"L-moments are widely used in hydrological studies for estimating the "
"characteristics of extreme values, as they provide more stable and "
"reliable estimates."
msgstr ""

#: ../../notebooks/regional_frequency_analysis.ipynb:2204
msgid ""
"**Regional Frequency Analysis**: This technique involves pooling data "
"from multiple sites or regions to estimate the frequency distribution of "
"extreme events, such as floods or droughts. The approach allows for the "
"determination of common statistical parameters across different "
"locations, enabling a more generalized and regional perspective on "
"extreme event behavior. Hosking and Wallis's method focuses on fitting a "
"regional frequency distribution and assessing how well it captures the "
"characteristics of the data."
msgstr ""

#: ../../notebooks/regional_frequency_analysis.ipynb:2207
msgid ""
"**Regional L-Moments**: These are L-moments calculated from pooled data "
"across multiple sites within a region. By applying regional L-moments, we"
" can estimate the parameters of regional frequency distributions and "
"better understand the occurrence of extreme events in different parts of "
"the region. This method improves the accuracy and robustness of "
"predictions for extreme events, particularly when data from multiple "
"sites are available."
msgstr ""

#: ../../notebooks/regional_frequency_analysis.ipynb:2209

"Let's start by calculating the L-moments for each station using "
"``xhydro.frequency_analysis.regional.calc_moments``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../notebooks/regional_frequency_analysis.ipynb:2823
msgid ""
"To perform regional frequency analysis, we need to reshape our datasets "
"of annual maximums and L-moments based on the groupings identified by the"
" clustering algorithm. Since there is no standardized naming convention "
"for this new dimension, ``xHydro`` uses the name ``group_id`` for the "
"cluster groupings. This reshaping process is handled by the function "
"``xhydro.frequency_analysis.regional.group_ds``, which organizes the data"
" according to the cluster assignments and prepares it for further "
"analysis."

"We now need to compute two important scores for evaluating the regional "
"frequency analysis: the *H-Score* and the *Z-Score*. The H-Score measures"
" the homogeneity of data across different sites or regions relative to "
"the regional model. It helps determine how well the data from multiple "
"sites align with the regional distribution. The Z-Score quantifies the "
"discrepancy between the observed and expected values, standardized by "
"their variability. It helps determine how well the theoretical "
"distribution (based on the regional model) fits the observed data."

"One method for quantifying uncertainties is to bootstrap the "
"observations. In this example, we will perform bootstrapping a small "
"number of times to illustrate the process, though in practice, a higher "
"number of iterations (e.g., 5000) is recommended to obtain more reliable "
"estimates. Bootstrapping resamples the observed data with replacement to "

"variability in the model's parameters and results."
msgstr ""

#: ../../notebooks/regional_frequency_analysis.ipynb:4932

"This can be accomplished by calling "
"``xhydro.frequency_analysis.uncertainties.bootstrap_obs``. One key "
"difference with local analyses is that for regional analyses, no fitting "
"step is involved, making this function significantly faster. Instead, the"
" results are obtained by first using "
"``xhydro.frequency_analysis.uncertainties.calc_moments_iter`` to compute "
"L-moments for all bootstrap samples. Then, "

"Another approach to estimating uncertainty is by considering multiple "
"regions for a single catchment of interest. This can be done by applying "
"different clustering methods or by performing a jackknife procedure on "
"the station list. While this process can be computationally intensive, we"
" present a simplified example here to illustrate the potential of this "
