"``xHydro`` provides a collection of functions designed to facilitate "
"hydrological modelling, focusing on two key models: `HYDROTEL "
"<https://github.com/INRS-Modelisation-hydrologique/hydrotel>`__ and a "
"suite of models emulated by the `Raven Hydrological Framework "
"<https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/>`__. It is important to note that Raven "
"already possesses an extensive Python library, `RavenPy "
"<https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy>`__, which enables users to build, "
"calibrate, and execute models. ``xHydro`` wraps some of these functions "
"to support multi-model assessments with HYDROTEL, though users seeking "
"advanced functionalities may prefer to use ``RavenPy`` directly."

"The ``xHydro`` modelling framework is based on a ``model_config`` "
