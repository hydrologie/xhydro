"Probable Maximum Precipitation (PMP) is the theoretical maximum amount of"
" precipitation that could occur at a specific location within a given "
"period of time, considering the most extreme meteorological conditions. "
"PMP is a critical parameter in hydrology, especially for the design of "
"infrastructure such as dams, reservoirs, and drainage systems."

msgid ""
"There are several methods for calculating PMP, each varying in complexity"
" and the type of data used. The method currently implemented in "
"``xHydro`` is based on the approach outlined by `Clavet-Gaumont et al. "
"(2017) <https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ejrh.2017.07.003>`__. This method "
"involves maximizing the precipitable water over a given location, which "
"refers to the total water vapor in the atmosphere that could potentially "
"be converted into precipitation under ideal conditions. By maximizing "
"this value, the method estimates the maximum precipitation that could "
"theoretically occur at the location."
