"We strongly recommend installing `xHydro` in an Anaconda Python "
"environment. Furthermore, due to the complexity of some packages, the "
"default dependency solver can take a long time to resolve the "
"environment. If `mamba` is not already your default solver, consider "
"running the following commands in order to speed up the process:"

"Some of the dependencies of `xHydro` can be difficult to install using "

"Alternatively, you can install `xHydro` using `pip`. All features in "
"`xHydro` itself will work, but some libraries (`xscen` and `xESMF` in "

"installing through `pip` might not currently be possible because of "
"`raven-hydro`."
