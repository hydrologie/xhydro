    "Optimal interpolation is a tool that allows combining a spatially distributed field (i.e. the \"background field\") with point observations in such a way that the entire field can be adjusted according to deviations between the observations and the field at the point of observations. For example, it can be used to combine a field of reanalysis precipitation (e.g. ERA5) with observation records, and thus adjust the reanalysis precipitation over the entire domain in a statistically optimal manner.\n",

    "This page demonstrates how to use `xhydro` to perform optimal interpolation using field-like simulations and point observations for hydrological modelling. In this case, the background field is a set of outputs from a distributed hydrological model and the observations correspond to real hydrometric stations. The aim is to correct the background field (i.e. the distributed hydrological simulations) using optimal interpolation, as in Lachance-Cloutier et al. (2017).\n",

We therefore need a covariance function that estimates (1) the degree of covariability between an observed and simulated point as a function of (2) the distance between those points.
