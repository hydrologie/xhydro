The entire framework is based on the `xh.modelling.hydrological_model` function and its `model_config` dictionary, which is meant to contain all necessary information to execute the given hydrological model. For example, depending on the model, it can store meteorological datasets directly, paths to datasets (netCDF files or other), csv configuration files, parameters, and basically anything that is required to configure and execute an hydrological model.\n",

    "It then becomes the User's responsibility to ensure that all required information for a given model are provided in the `model_config` object, both in the data preparation stage and in the hydrological model implementation.
