    "`xHydro` provides a collection of functions designed to facilitate hydrological modelling, focusing on two key models: [HYDROTEL](https://github.com/INRS-Modelisation-hydrologique/hydrotel) and a suite of models emulated by the [Raven Hydrological Framework](https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/). It is important to note that Raven already possesses an extensive Python library, [RavenPy](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy), which enables users to build, calibrate, and execute models. `xHydro` wraps some of these functions to support multi-model assessments with HYDROTEL, though users seeking advanced functionalities may prefer to use `RavenPy` directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary contribution of `xHydro` to hydrological modelling is thus its support for HYDROTEL, a model that previously lacked a dedicated Python library. However, building a HYDROTEL project is best done using PHYSITEL and the HYDROTEL GUI, both of which are proprietary software. Therefore, for the time being, `xHydro` is designed to facilitate the execution and modification of an already established HYDROTEL project, rather than assist in building one from scratch.\n",

    "HYDROTEL and Raven vary in terms of required inputs and available functions, but an effort will be made to standardize the outputs as much as possible. Currently, all models include the following three functions:\n",
