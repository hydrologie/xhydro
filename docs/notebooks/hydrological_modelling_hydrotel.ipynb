    "`xHydro` provides a collection of functions designed to facilitate hydrological modelling, focusing on two key models: [HYDROTEL](https://github.com/INRS-Modelisation-hydrologique/hydrotel) and a suite of models emulated by the [Raven Hydrological Framework](https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/). It is important to note that Raven already possesses an extensive Python library, [RavenPy](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy), which enables users to build, calibrate, and execute models. `xHydro` wraps some of these functions to support multi-model assessments with HYDROTEL, though users seeking advanced functionalities may prefer to use `RavenPy` directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary contribution of `xHydro` to hydrological modelling is thus its support for HYDROTEL, a model that previously lacked a dedicated Python library. However, building a HYDROTEL project is best done using PHYSITEL and the HYDROTEL GUI, both of which are proprietary software. Therefore, for the time being, `xHydro` is designed to facilitate the execution and modification of an already established HYDROTEL project, rather than assist in building one from scratch.\n",

    "HYDROTEL and Raven vary in terms of required inputs and available functions, but an effort will be made to standardize the outputs as much as possible. Currently, all models include the following three functions:\n",
    "\n",
    "- `.run()`: Executes the model, reformats the outputs to be compatible with analysis tools in `xHydro`, and returns the simulated streamflow as a `xarray.Dataset`.\n",
    "  - The streamflow variable will be named `q` and will have units of `m3 s-1`.\n",
    "  - For 1D data (such as hydrometric stations), the corresponding dimension in the dataset will be identified by the `cf_role: timeseries_id` attribute.\n",

    "\n",
    "- A project file located in the main directory, which may have any given name (e.g., `SLNO.csv`).\n",
    "- A `simulation/simulation/simulation.csv` file that manages all the parameters for the run, including simulation dates, the path to meteorological data, and the physical processes to be used.\n",

    "\n",
    "- `use_defaults = False` (default): This will attempt to read the three required files from the project folder.\n",
    "- `use_defaults = True`: This option provides an approximation of typical parameters from a project, but it may need to be reviewed and adjusted.\n",
    "\n",
    "In all cases, providing additional configuration options to `project_config`, `simulation_config`, or `output_config` when initializing the HYDROTEL model, or through the `.update_config()` function later, will update the corresponding CSV files accordingly. \n",

    "The following parameters must always be specified:\n",

    "- `DATE FIN` (end date)\n",
    "- `PAS DE TEMPS` (timestep frequency)\n",

Additionally, either `FICHIER STATIONS METEO` (meteorological stations file) or `FICHIER GRILLE METEO` (meteorological grid file) must be specified to guide the model to the meteorological data.\n",
