    "- Frequential indicators: These indicators describe hydrological events that occur at recurring intervals. They include metrics like the maximum 20-year flow (`Qmax20`) or the minimum 2-year 7-day average flow in summer (`Q7min2_summer`). The methodology for computing these indicators is covered in the [Local Frequency Analysis](local_frequency_analysis.ipynb) notebook.\n",

This function is built on top of `xclim` and supports both predefined indicators, such as `xclim.indicator.land.doy_qmax`, as well as custom indicators created using `xclim.core.indicator.Indicator.from_dict`. The latter option can be quite complex—see the box below for more information. For advanced users, indicator construction can also be defined through a YAML file.\n",
