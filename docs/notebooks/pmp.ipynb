Since in this example we are working with daily time steps, these thresholds were adjusted to 1 mm/day and 0.4 mm/day, respectively."

For the precipitable water corresponding to a certain event, we consider only time steps that show at least the minimum amount snowfall.\n",
    "   - **m3**:   Same events as those selected for M2, but if additionally more than the minimum amount of rain occurs, the precipitable water is multiplied by the ratio of snowfall [mm water equivalent] over total precipitation.
