    "## Regional Frequency Analysis\n",
    "\n",
    "**Hosking and Wallis** introduced a method for regional frequency analysis based on L-moments, which are particularly useful for analyzing extreme events across different regions. Hereâ€™s a brief overview of the key concepts:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **L-Moments**: L-moments are statistical measures that are derived from linear combinations of order statistics. They offer a more robust alternative to traditional moments (like mean and variance), especially in the presence of outliers or when dealing with small sample sizes. L-moments are widely used in hydrological studies for estimating the characteristics of extreme values, as they provide more stable and reliable estimates.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Regional Frequency Analysis**: This technique involves pooling data from multiple sites or regions to estimate the frequency distribution of extreme events, such as floods or droughts. The approach allows for the determination of common statistical parameters across different locations, enabling a more generalized and regional perspective on extreme event behavior. Hosking and Wallis's method focuses on fitting a regional frequency distribution and assessing how well it captures the characteristics of the data.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Regional L-Moments**: These are L-moments calculated from pooled data across multiple sites within a region. By applying regional L-moments, we can estimate the parameters of regional frequency distributions and better understand the occurrence of extreme events in different parts of the region. This method improves the accuracy and robustness of predictions for extreme events, particularly when data from multiple sites are available.\n",

These uncertainties often stem from data quality, the choice of distribution, and the estimation of parameters.

In this example, we will perform bootstrapping a small number of times to illustrate the process, though in practice, a higher number of iterations (e.g., 5000) is recommended to obtain more reliable estimates. Bootstrapping resamples the observed data with replacement to generate multiple datasets, which can then be used to assess the variability in the model's parameters and results.\n",

Instead, the results are obtained by first using `xhydro.frequency_analysis.uncertainties.calc_moments_iter` to compute L-moments for all bootstrap samples. Then, `xhydro.frequency_analysis.uncertainties.calc_q_iter` is used to calculate the return periods based on those L-moments."

For instance, if we have 35 bootstraps and roughly 220 regions, this will generate a total of around 7,700 samples for further analysis.\n"
