    "# Hydrological modelling - Raven (distributed)\n",
    "\n",
    "`xHydro` provides a collection of functions designed to facilitate hydrological modelling, focusing on two key models: [HYDROTEL](https://github.com/INRS-Modelisation-hydrologique/hydrotel) and a suite of models emulated by the [Raven Hydrological Framework](https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/). It is important to note that Raven already possesses an extensive Python library, [RavenPy](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy), which enables users to build, calibrate, and execute models. `xHydro` wraps some of these functions to support multi-model assessments with HYDROTEL, though users seeking advanced functionalities may prefer to use `RavenPy` directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary contribution of `xHydro` to hydrological modelling is thus its support for HYDROTEL, a model that previously lacked a dedicated Python library. This Notebook covers `RavenPy` models, but a similar notebook for `HYDROTEL` is available [here](hydrological_modelling_hydrotel.ipynb).\n",

    "Raven relies on Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) for its hydrological simulations. Distributed models require a long list of HRU attributes, which is not yet fully supported by `xHydro`. Users are encouraged to consult the [BasinMaker documentation](https://hydrology.uwaterloo.ca/basinmaker/) for a complete list of HRU attributes, and specifically the 'data specification file' available on their homepage. For distributed modelling, `xHydro` calls upon the `BasinMakerExtractor` class of `RavenPy` to extract HRU data from a shapefile, so users must ensure that their shapefile is formatted correctly.\n",

    "Additionally, while BasinMaker will produce attributes such as `Landuse_ID`, these will not be passed on to the `RavenPy` model. Instead, the HRU should contain relevant land use attributes that can be directly mapped to the hydrological model's arguments. For example, for the HBV-EC model, which is currently the only distributed model available in `Raven`, the following attributes are used instead: `LAND_USE_C`, `VEG_C`, and `SOIL_PROF`, which represent land use, vegetation, and soil profile respectively.\n",

There is currently no good documentation on how to do this, but you can refer to the class definition of the `HBVEC` model in `ravenpy.config.emulators.hbvec.py`.\n",
