    "# Hydrological modelling - Raven (distributed)\n",
    "\n",
    "`xHydro` provides a collection of functions designed to facilitate hydrological modelling, focusing on two key models: [HYDROTEL](https://github.com/INRS-Modelisation-hydrologique/hydrotel) and a suite of models emulated by the [Raven Hydrological Framework](https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/). It is important to note that Raven already possesses an extensive Python library, [RavenPy](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy), which enables users to build, calibrate, and execute models. `xHydro` wraps some of these functions to support multi-model assessments with HYDROTEL, though users seeking advanced functionalities may prefer to use `RavenPy` directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary contribution of `xHydro` to hydrological modelling is thus its support for HYDROTEL, a model that previously lacked a dedicated Python library. This Notebook covers `RavenPy` models, but a similar notebook for `HYDROTEL` is available [here](hydrological_modelling_hydrotel.ipynb).\n",

Currently, `RavenPy` provides no straightforward way to open and modify these files. For instance, changing simulation dates or meteorological data directly through the files is not yet supported. Until this feature is added, all relevant information must be provided to `RavenPy` via the `model_config` dictionary in order to successfully run the model. \n",

    "Raven relies on Hydrological Response Units (HRUs) for its hydrological simulations. Distributed models require a long list of HRU attributes, which is not yet fully supported by `xHydro`. Users are encouraged to consult the [BasinMaker documentation](https://hydrology.uwaterloo.ca/basinmaker/) for a complete list of HRU attributes, and specifically the 'data specification file' available on their homepage. For distributed modelling, `xHydro` calls upon the `BasinMakerExtractor` class of `RavenPy` to extract HRU data from a shapefile, so users must ensure that their shapefile is formatted correctly.\n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, while BasinMaker will produce attributes such as `Landuse_ID`, these will not be passed on to the `RavenPy` model. Instead, the HRU should contain relevant land use attributes that can be directly mapped to the hydrological model's arguments. For example, for the HBV-EC model, which is currently the only distributed model available in `Raven`, the following attributes are used instead: `LAND_USE_C`, `VEG_C`, and `SOIL_PROF`, which represent land use, vegetation, and soil profile respectively.\n",

    "By default, HBV-EC as defined in `RavenPy` only understands a unique `LAND_USE_C` (`LU_ALL`), `VEG_C` (`VEG_ALL`), and `SOIL_PROF` (`DEFAULT_P`). If you want to use different classes, you will need to modify the `model_config` dictionary to include the relevant keys. There is currently no good documentation on how to do this, but you can refer to the class definition of the `HBVEC` model in `ravenpy.config.emulators.hbvec.py`.\n",
