    "# Hydrological modelling - Raven\n",
    "\n",
    "`xHydro` provides a collection of functions designed to facilitate hydrological modelling, focusing on two key models: [HYDROTEL](https://github.com/INRS-Modelisation-hydrologique/hydrotel) and a suite of models emulated by the [Raven Hydrological Framework](https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/). It is important to note that Raven already possesses an extensive Python library, [RavenPy](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy), which enables users to build, calibrate, and execute models. `xHydro` wraps some of these functions to support multi-model assessments with HYDROTEL, though users seeking advanced functionalities may prefer to use `RavenPy` directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary contribution of `xHydro` to hydrological modelling is thus its support for HYDROTEL, a model that previously lacked a dedicated Python library. This Notebook covers `RavenPy` models, but a similar notebook for `HYDROTEL` is available [here](hydrological_modelling_hydrotel.ipynb).\n",

    "When building a model from scratch, a calibration step is necessary to find the optimal set of parameters. Model calibration involves a loop of several iterations, where: model parameters are selected, the model is run, and the results are compared to observed data. In `xHydro`, the calibration function utilizes `SPOTPY` to carry out the optimization process.\n",
