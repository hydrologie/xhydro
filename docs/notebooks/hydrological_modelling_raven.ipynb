    "# Hydrological modelling - Raven (lumped)\n",
    "\n",
    "`xHydro` provides a collection of functions designed to facilitate hydrological modelling, focusing on two key models: [HYDROTEL](https://github.com/INRS-Modelisation-hydrologique/hydrotel) and a suite of models emulated by the [Raven Hydrological Framework](https://raven.uwaterloo.ca/). It is important to note that Raven already possesses an extensive Python library, [RavenPy](https://github.com/CSHS-CWRA/RavenPy), which enables users to build, calibrate, and execute models. `xHydro` wraps some of these functions to support multi-model assessments with HYDROTEL, though users seeking advanced functionalities may prefer to use `RavenPy` directly. \n",
    "\n",
    "The primary contribution of `xHydro` to hydrological modelling is thus its support for HYDROTEL, a model that previously lacked a dedicated Python library. This Notebook covers `RavenPy` models, but a similar notebook for `HYDROTEL` is available [here](hydrological_modelling_hydrotel.ipynb).\n",

    "Currently, `RavenPy` provides no straightforward way to open and modify the Raven `.rv*` files. For instance, changing simulation dates or meteorological data directly through the files is not yet supported. Until this feature is added, some basic functions have been integrated into `xHydro`, but should be used with care.\n",
    "\n",
    "The basic information, such as `start_date`, `end_date`, and `parameters`, are stored directly in the `RavenpyModel` class and can be manually updated. Similarly, if additional arguments had been given to the model during initialization, they are stored within a dictionary under `RavenpyModel.kwargs`, which can be accessed and modified as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed streamflow, HRU characteristics and meteorological data are stored under the `.qobs`, `.hru` and `.meteo` attributes respectively, but can be much trickier to update, since the associated `RavenPy` commands must be reconstructed again. Therefore, it is strongly recommended to use the `.update_data` method to update these. This function calls upon a subset of the same arguments used when initializing a Raven model:\n"
