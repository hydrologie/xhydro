-------------------
Contributors to this version: Thomas-Charles Fortier Filion (:user:`TC-FF`) Gabriel Rondeau-Genesse (:user:`RondeauG`), Trevor James Smith (:user:`Zeitsperre`), Julián Ospina (:user:`ospinajulian`).

New features and enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Added a new module `xhydro.extreme_value_analysis` that wraps the `Extremes.jl` package for Julia. (:pull:`175`).
  * The module provides functions to fit extreme value distributions to data, compute return levels, and get uncertainty estimates.
  * The module is designed to be optional and requires the user to have Julia installed with the `Extremes.jl` package, along with the `PyJuliaCall` package for Python.
  * You can use `pip install xhydro[julia]` to install the required dependencies.

Internal changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* `"land_use_classification"` default collection has been changed to `"io-lulc-annual-v02"`, as the previous one will be deprecated in December 2024. (:pull:`227`).
* Added some collection, year, resolution and history attributes to `xarray` output of `"land_use_classification"`. (:pull:`227`).
* Added a "User-Agent" to fix an issue related to `pooch` calls in the notebooks for recent ReadTheDocs builds. (:pull:`231`).
* Patched the ``xhydro.testing.helpers.devereaux()`` function to add a "User-Agent" by default. (:pull:`234`).
* Fixed the URL joining logic of the ``load_registry()`` and ``devereaux()`` functions in the `xhydro.testing.helpers` module. (:pull:`234`).
* Updated ``uncertainties.calc_q_iter()`` to allow for ungaged catchments. (:pull:`235`).
* Updated the cookiecutter template. (:pull:`252`):
    * GitHub Actions versions and Python dependencies updated.
    * Added pre-commit hooks for `vulture` (find dead code), `codespell` (spelling mistakes), `gitleaks` (token commit prevention), and `zizmor` (workflow security).
    * Added an advanced CodeQL workflow for security scanning.

v0.4.1 (2024-11-07)
-------------------
Contributors to this version: Gabriel Rondeau-Genesse (:user:`RondeauG`), Trevor James Smith (:user:`Zeitsperre`), Louise Arnal (:user:`lou-a`).

New features and enhancements
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* A `periods` parameter was added to ``frequency_analysis.local.fit`` to compute multiple separate periods with a single call. (:pull:`219`).
* In ``xhydro.cc.sampled_indicators``, the `delta_type` argument can now be a dictionary or None, in which case the attribute `delta_kind` is used. (:pull:`220`).
* In ``xhydro.cc.sampled_indicators``, weights along a `time` or `horizon` dimension will no longer reduce that dimension. (:pull:`220`).

Bug fixes
^^^^^^^^^
* Fixed a bug in `xhydro.modelling.format_input` where the function would fail if the input data was a `dask` array. (:pull:`214`).
* The `executable` parameter in the Hydrotel model class is now always required. (:pull:`214`).

Breaking changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* The `xhydro` testing utilities have been rewritten to use `pooch` for downloading and caching testing datasets from `hydrologie/xhydro-testdata`. (:pull:`212`).
* The `xhydro` testing utilities now require `pytest-xdist` as a development dependency. (:pull:`212`).

* The ``xhydro.pmp`` module has been moved to ``xhydro.indicators.pmp``. (:pull:`226`).

Internal changes
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
* Updated the notebooks to reduce the load on ReadTheDocs. (:pull:`211`).
* Tests can now be run using the `pytest-xdist` plugin for distributed testing. See the `pytest-xdist documentation <https://pytest-xdist.readthedocs.io/en/stable/>`_ for more information. (:pull:`212`).
* Several tests reliant on online servers and services have been marked as `online` to prevent them from running in contexts where internet access is limited. (:pull:`212`).
* Many function docstrings and type hints have been updated for accuracy and precision. (:pull:`212`).
* The `xHydro` project now has a set of logos for use in documentation, the readme, and other materials. (:pull:`217`).
* ``xhydro.indicators`` is now a package with submodules for different types of indicators. Previous functions have been moved to a `generic` submodule and are imported at the top level for backwards compatibility. (:pull:`226`).
* ``xh.testing.utils.publish_release_notes`` now has a `latest` parameter to print only the latest release notes. (:pull:`228`).
