    Elasticity index
    Compute the median of yearly streamflow elasticity index for given catchments,
    where elasticity (εₚ) is defined as the relative change in streamflow (ΔQ/Q)
    divided by the relative change in precipitation (ΔP/P)

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : xarray.DataArray
        Daily discharge data
    pr : xarray.DataArray
        Daily precipitation data
    freq: str
        Resampling frequency (e.g., 'YS' for year starting in Jan)

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        Nonparametric estimator for streamflow elasticity index (dimensionless)
    Notes
    -----
    A value of εp greater than 1 indicates that streamflow is highly sensitive to precipitation changes,
    meaning a 1% change in precipitation will lead to a greater than 1% change in streamflow.
    A value less than 1 suggests a less sensitive relationship.

    Calculate the slope of the flow duration curve mid-section between the 33% and 66% exceedance probabilities.
    Aggregated analysis : Single value as a long-term benchmark

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : xarray.DataArray
        Daily streamflow data, expected to have a discharge unit.

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        Slope of the FDC between the 33% and 66% exceedance probabilities, unitless.

    Notes
    -----
    Single Returned numeric values are positive.

    High slope value :
    Steep slopes of the midsegment FDC are typically a characteristic behavior for watersheds having ‘flashy’ responses
    (for exemple due to small soil storage capacity and hence larger percentage of overland flow).

    Lower slope value :
    Flatter slopes of the midsegment FDC are associated with watersheds having slower and
    more sustained groundwater low response.

    """
    Total runoff ratio

    Compute the ratio of streamflow measured at a stream gauge station to the total precipitation over the watershed.
    Also known as the runoff coefficient, it is higher in watersheds with steep slopes,
    impervious surfaces or high evapotranspiration.

    Parameters
    ----------
    q : xarray.DataArray
        Streamflow in [discharge] units, will be converted to [m3/s].
    a : xarray.DataArray
        Watershed area [area] units, will be converted to in [km²].
    pr : xarray.DataArray
        mean daily Precipitation [precipitation] units, will be converted to [mm/hr].

    Returns
    -------
    xarray.DataArray
        Single value rainfall-runoff ratio (RRR) as long-term benchmark.

    Notes
    -----
    - Total Runoff ratio values are comparable to Runoff coefficients,
    - Values near 0 mean most precipitation infiltrates watershed soil or is lost to evapotranspiration.
    - Values near 1 mean most precipitation leaves the watershed as runoff;
      possible causes are impervious surfaces from urban sprawl, thin soils, steep slopes, etc.
    - Long-term averages are typically ≤ 1
